# Arduino-ThermoresponsiveCup
In this project, I will be building a Thermoresponsive cup holder that will be able to detect the correct temperature of the liquid inside the cup and provide the users with a visual output signifying if the liquid is too hot, too cold or is of the right drinkable temperature.
